Project 1 for Data Structures


This project implements two data structures a priority queue and stack. This project reads information about countries from a csv file. From there it inserts the countries into five priority queues based on GDP per capita. It then prints out the priority queues. It then removes the countries from the priority queues and pushes the country objects onto a stack and then prints the stack.
